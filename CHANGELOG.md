# Changelog

All notable changes to Collie are recorded here. The format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/), and the project uses
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/). The newest `## [x.y.z]` heading **must** match the
`version` in `herdr-plugin.toml`, `package.json`, and `web/package.json` (enforced by
`scripts/check-version.sh`). See [`CLAUDE.md`](./CLAUDE.md) → *Versioning* for the bump policy.

## [0.4.0] - 2026-07-04

### Added
- Block-based terminal renderer (in progress on feature/block-renderer): rendering now flows through
  a semantic Block AST (styled lines → typed blocks → React components); this release contains the
  raw-block foundation — visually identical, groundwork for native prompt/tool-call rendering.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-07-03

A full-codebase review pass: four audit agents (backend, frontend, security, ops/product) swept the
tree; everything they found was verified, fixed, and the top feature gaps were built.

### Added
- **Reply from the notification.** Needs-you pushes now carry up to two quick-reply action buttons
  (agent-aware: codex gets `yes`/`no`, others `yes`/`continue`; bridge sends `quickReplies` in the
  payload). Tapping one POSTs the reply straight from the service worker and confirms with a silent
  "Sent ✓" — no app open needed. Body tap still deep-links as before.
- **Find in output.** A magnifier in the pane header opens a find bar: case-insensitive match over
  the visible buffer, match count, prev/next that cooperates with the scroll-freeze, highlights
  rendered through the same React-text-node path (XSS boundary untouched).
- **Load older scrollback.** A "load older" row at the top of the mirror grows the fetched window
  600 lines at a time (up to 5000; the bridge clamps reads at 10000), preserving your scroll
  position across the refetch.
- **Destructive-input confirm.** Replies matching a reviewed pattern list (`rm -rf`, `sudo`,
  `git push --force`, `dd if=`, `mkfs`, redirects to system paths, …) flip Send into a two-tap
  "Really send?" state for ~3s — same pattern the `/clear` palette action already used.
- **Audit log.** Every write action (reply, keys, upload, tab/workspace create, pane close) appends
  a single JSONL line — timestamp, action, pane, device, truncated params — to
  `<state-dir>/audit.log` (mode 0600). Audit failures never block the action itself.
- `COLLIE_PUBLIC_HOSTS` env var — an explicit Host-header allowlist. When set, requests addressed
  to any other Host are rejected before origin logic, defeating DNS rebinding. Strongly
  recommended (set it to your MagicDNS name); effectively mandatory with `COLLIE_SERVE_MODE=http`.
- Startup warnings when `COLLIE_TRUSTED_USER` or `COLLIE_PUBLIC_HOSTS` is unset — parity with the
  existing bind/allowlist warnings, since an empty trusted-user means any tailnet device has write
  access.
- Uploaded images are now swept after 48h (was: kept forever).

### Changed
- **Builds are gated.** `bun run build` (root) and `collie-ctl.sh build` now typecheck bridge and
  web before building, and build into `dist-staging` with an atomic swap — a failed build can no
  longer leave an empty `web/dist` serving 503s. The pre-push hook typechecks both sides too
  (`SKIP_TYPECHECK=1` to bypass once). Root tsconfig now enforces `noUnusedLocals/Parameters`.
- **Write requests without an `Origin` header are rejected** unless they arrive on loopback
  (browsers always send Origin on POST; curl-on-host keeps working).
- Idle lock is now timestamp-based: backgrounding/foregrounding the app no longer resets the
  countdown, and returning past the deadline locks immediately.
- The composer moved into its own `<Composer>` component; `agent-chat.tsx` slimmed by ~230 lines.
- A reply whose text lands but whose submit keystroke fails now reports "typed into the pane but
  not submitted — check the pane before resending" (and `textDelivered: true`) instead of a generic
  error that invited double-sends.
- systemd unit hardened (`NoNewPrivileges`, `PrivateTmp`) and made persistent
  (`StartLimitIntervalSec=0`, `RestartSec=5`) so a crash-loop can't leave the service permanently
  down while you're phone-only.
- Notification deep links URL-encode the pane id; sheets manage focus (focus in on open, restore on
  close, `aria-labelledby`); space status dots gained screen-reader text; pinch-zoom re-enabled
  (removed `maximum-scale=1`).

### Fixed
- **Socket leak on RPC timeout** — a stalled Herdr left the Unix-socket FD open on every timed-out
  request; under the 1.5s poll cadence this exhausted file descriptors and wedged the bridge. Every
  terminal path now closes the socket.
- **UTF-8 corruption across socket chunks** — multi-byte characters (box drawing, emoji) straddling
  a socket-read boundary rendered as `�`; replies are now stream-decoded.
- **Overlapping polls** — a slow Herdr let 1.5s ticks pile up 3-4 concurrent polls; a tick is now
  skipped while the previous poll is in flight.
- **Upload buffering** — a too-large upload was buffered fully into RAM before the 10MB check;
  oversized `Content-Length` is now rejected up front and `Bun.serve` caps request bodies at 12MB.
- Push subscription saves are serialized and written atomically (temp+rename); concurrent
  add/prune can no longer drop a subscription. State files are written 0600 in 0700 dirs.
- First PWA load no longer flashes an immediate reload (service-worker `controllerchange` on
  initial claim was treated as an update).
- A rotated VAPID key now unsubscribes the stale push subscription and re-subscribes fresh instead
  of silently dead-ending pushes.
- Superseded loader revalidations are aborted (`request.signal` threaded through); raw key presses
  debounce their revalidate (one refetch per burst instead of one per keystroke).
- Slash-command insert appends to the draft instead of overwriting it; tap-to-focus no longer
  collapses an active text selection (copying pane output works now).
- `envInt` config parsing rejects garbage and out-of-range values (negative poll/debounce
  intervals, invalid ports) with a warning instead of silently accepting them.
- Static-file path guard now checks the directory boundary (`dist` vs `dist-*`); `?lines=` is
  clamped; API/static responses carry `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff` and
  `Referrer-Policy: no-referrer`; graceful shutdown drains in-flight requests.
- Pre-commit version guard now also covers `web/vite.config.ts`, `web/index.html`,
  `web/package.json`, `web/public/`, `systemd/`, and root `package.json`, and requires the new
  version to sort strictly above the old one.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-06-30

### Changed
- **Smarter push notifications.** A blocked/done alert is no longer fire-and-forget. Each one now
  waits a short **debounce window** (`COLLIE_NOTIFY_DELAY_MS`, default 30s) before it sends; an agent
  you clear at your desk within that window never reaches your phone. Alerts that *do* fire are
  **retracted** automatically once the agent resolves (or its pane closes), so handled work stops
  piling up on your lock screen. The service worker also **suppresses** the system notification when a
  Collie tab is already open and visible (the in-app status surfaces it instead).
- **Coalesced into one notification.** The whole herd shares a single notification slot: one agent
  shows the named, deep-linked alert; several collapse into a *"N agents need you"* digest (tap → the
  triage home) that updates in place as agents come and go, instead of stacking N separate alerts.

### Added
- **Do Not Disturb / snooze** (Settings → *Do not disturb*): pause all push for 30m / 1h / 4h, or
  resume early. Server-enforced and self-expiring, so it quiets every device — and it clears whatever
  is already on the lock screen the moment you snooze. The current deadline rides the snapshot, so it
  stays in sync across devices.
- `COLLIE_NOTIFY_DELAY_MS` env var — the push debounce window in ms (default `30000`; `0` notifies on
  the next tick with no debounce).
- `POST /api/notifications/snooze` — set/clear the global snooze (`{ snoozedUntil: number | null }`);
  the active deadline is reported on the snapshot as `notifications.snoozedUntil`.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-06-30

Initial public release of **Collie** — a phone web UI to monitor and reply to your Herdr agent
herd over Tailscale.

### Added
- **Mobile-first PWA** (Vite + React + TypeScript + Tailwind v4 + shadcn): a triage dashboard
  (Spaces overview + Needs-you / Working / Idle agent groups), a per-agent colored terminal mirror,
  an agent-aware slash-command palette (Claude Code, Codex, pi, opencode), a special-keys pad with
  inline arrows/Tab, per-agent brand icons, image upload, and animated view transitions. Installable,
  with an auto-updating service worker and a build-stamp footer.
- **Bun/TypeScript bridge** over Herdr's Unix socket: a polled live snapshot (adaptive cadence,
  gzip + `ETag`/`304`) plus reply / keys / upload endpoints, and space/tab/pane management (create
  shell panes, switch, kill) through a unified nav hub.
- **Runs as a `systemd --user` service** supervised independently of Herdr, with a `tailscale serve`
  launcher (`scripts/collie-ctl.sh`) and a thin Herdr plugin (`herdr.collie`) exposing
  start / stop / restart / status / url / version / update / uninstall actions. One-command update
  (pull → rebuild → restart → re-link) for the linked checkout.
- **Optional Web Push (VAPID) notifications** when an agent needs you, with a custom service-worker
  push handler that renders the real message and deep-links the tap to the agent's pane.
- **Security posture:** loopback-only bind, `tailscale serve` as the sole ingress (never `funnel`),
  a same-origin gate, an optional `COLLIE_TRUSTED_USER` identity check, optional per-device
  authorisation via a trusted upstream header, a strict CSP, and terminal output rendered as React
  text nodes (the XSS boundary).
