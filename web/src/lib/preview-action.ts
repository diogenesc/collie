// The preview-variant race guards — prompt-action's philosophy applied to the preview
// AskUserQuestion dialog, whose choreography is MULTI-step (grammar/NOTES_NOTES.md):
//
//   - Selecting an option is digit → verify pointer → Enter. A `[digit, Enter]` pair in ONE
//     send_keys call picks the WRONG row (the TUI processes both keys in one input chunk and the
//     Enter still sees the pre-digit pointer — observed live), so the Enter is only sent after a
//     fresh read shows the pointer on the tapped row.
//   - Adding/editing a note is n → verify the input focused → clear → type → Escape. Focus is not
//     instantaneous, keystrokes sent early are misrouted, and Enter inside the input would submit
//     the dialog — so every step that types is gated on a verified pane state, and Enter is never
//     part of the recipe.
//
// Every flow starts with the same guard as submitPromptOption/submitWizardKeys: a FRESH pane read,
// the unconditional revision check, and a full model re-derivation compared against what the user
// tapped (Herdr 0.7.x's revision is a stub — the re-derivation is the load-bearing check). The
// mid-flight verification polls then re-derive from fresh reads again; a dialog that drifts
// structurally at any point aborts with "changed" BEFORE anything irreversible is sent.
