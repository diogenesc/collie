// The wizard race guard — prompt-action's philosophy applied to the multi-question wizard. Every
// wizard tap (an option digit, Left/Right navigation, the review step's submit/cancel) types into
// a REAL terminal, and under the INCREMENTAL round-trip model (WIZARD_NOTES.md) each tap is one
// keystroke against the step currently on screen — so before sending we re-fetch the pane and
// confirm the wizard the user tapped is still the wizard that's there:
//
//   1. A FRESH pane read for the same window.
//   2. The fresh `revision` must equal the one the wizard was detected against — unconditionally
//      (the 304 path's cache advances with polls while a frozen mirror stands still; see
//      prompt-action.ts for the full rationale).
//   3. The fresh buffer must re-derive to an EQUAL wizard (phase, chips, question/options or
//      answers). Herdr 0.7.x's revision is empirically a stub (always 0), so this re-derivation is
//      the load-bearing check — and it is exactly what makes single-keystroke taps safe: a wizard
//      that advanced, re-rendered, or vanished between render and tap can never match.
//
// A failed guard discards the tap and reports "changed" so the caller can refresh the mirror.
