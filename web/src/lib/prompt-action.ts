// The prompt-select race guard, factored out of AgentChat so it's directly testable (and reused by
// the component's integration test). Tapping a menu button can type into a REAL terminal, and the
// pane may have moved on between render and tap — so before sending we re-fetch the pane and confirm
// nothing changed underfoot:
//
//   1. A FRESH pane read for the same window.
//   2. The fresh read's `revision` must equal the one the menu was detected against — checked
//      UNCONDITIONALLY. A 304 Not Modified only proves the buffer is unchanged since the ETag
//      cache's LAST background poll, NOT since the (possibly frozen) snapshot the user tapped on —
//      the cache advances with every poll while a frozen mirror stands still. The cached 304 body
//      carries its own `revision`, so the comparison works on both paths.
//   3. The fresh buffer must additionally still re-derive to the same {question, options}
//      (family + labels) — on EVERY path, 304 included, because Herdr 0.7.x's revision field is
//      empirically a stub (always 0) and the re-derivation is the only load-bearing check today.
//
// Only then do we send the option's keys through the existing sendKeys write path. A failed guard
// discards the tap and reports "changed" so the caller can surface a "menu changed" notice.
