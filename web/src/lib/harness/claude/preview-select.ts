// Preview-variant AskUserQuestion detection — the grammar that recognises Claude Code's PREVIEW
// dialog (options in a fixed left column, the pointed option's preview pane on the right, and the
// per-question "Notes:" affordance) at the TAIL of a pane buffer, and lifts it into a
// `PreviewSelectModel` the UI renders natively — including the note add/edit flow.
//
// This variant renders for a question that is !multiSelect AND has ≥1 option with a `preview`
// field, both as a single-question dialog and as a step inside the multi-question wizard. Its
// choreography differs sharply from the standard select/wizard (digits only MOVE the pointer, the
// `n` key opens a note input, Enter inside that input submits/advances) — the verified ground
// truth lives in NOTES_NOTES.md. The T2/T7 grammars never match this layout (the footer sits far
// below the option rows, outside their MAX_FOOTER_GAP), so this detector adds a new surface rather
// than re-arbitrating an existing one.
//
// Everything here is PURE over `StyledLine[]`, fixture-driven (web/src/fixtures/panes/
// claude--*preview*.txt), and never touches a pane or the network.
