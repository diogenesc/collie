// Semantic Block AST — the intermediate representation between the ANSI parse and the React
// renderer. `raw` mirrors terminal output verbatim; `prompt-select` lifts a Claude single-choice
// dialog into a typed payload the renderer draws as buttons. The discriminated union is shaped so
// further grammars (tool calls, …) are added as new `kind`s without disturbing these.
//
// The pipeline is: parseAnsi(text) → AnsiSegment[] → splitLines(segments) → StyledLine[] →
// buildBlocks(lines, ctx) → Block[]. These functions are PURE (no React) and, together with the
// parser, run once per unique text (memoised by the renderer), so they're off the hot polling path.
// The Claude-only grammars in buildBlocks (prompt-select detection, chrome stripping) live in
// ./grammar; the "which agents get them" decision is the single `hasBlockGrammar` predicate
// (./grammar/agents) — every other agent keeps pure raw output.
//
// Invariant (relied on by find-in-output): joining every RAW block's line text with "\n" reproduces
// the visible mirror text character-for-character. Find operates on global character offsets over
// that string; a prompt-select block is rendered as buttons, so its text is NOT part of that space
// (find covers the raw mirror only).
